# --- Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm --- PART 2

# Opcodes (like 1, 2, or 99) mark the beginning of an instruction.
# The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's parameters.
# For example, in the instruction 1,2,3,4, 1 is the opcode; 2, 3, and 4 are the parameters.
# The instruction 99 contains only an opcode and has no parameters.

# The address of the current instruction is called the instruction pointer; it starts at 0.
# After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by the number of
# values in the instruction; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is ~
# always 4 (1 opcode + 3 parameters) for the add and multiply instructions.
# (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by 1, but it halts the program instead.)

# "With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist,
# you need to determine what pair of inputs produces the output 19690720."

# The inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses 1 and 2,
# just like before. In this program, the value placed in address 1 is called the noun, and the
# value placed in address 2 is called the verb. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99, inclusive.

# Once the program has halted, its output is available at address 0, also just like before.
# Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first reset the computer's memory to the
# values in the program (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.

# Find the input noun and verb that cause the program to produce the output 19690720.
# What is 100 * noun + verb? (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2, the answer would be 1202.)
